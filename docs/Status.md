## Test Summary

| Metric | v0.2.6 | v0.2.7 | v0.2.8 | Delta |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Tests | 894 | 1466 | 1466 | — |
| Passing | 893 | 1465 | 1466 | +1 |
| Failing | 0 | 1 | 0 | -1 |
| Skipped | 1 | 7 | 7 | — |
| Typecheck | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| Build | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — |

The single failing test in v0.2.7 (`main.test.ts › timeline jumps use exact message-list scroll positioning`) was a stale source-grep assertion left over from the extraction of `scrollToTurn`/`scrollMessageToTop` into `src/chat/webview/ui/scrollMarkers.ts`. The test now reads from `scrollMarkersSource` where the implementation actually lives.

## Feature Parity (CLI → Extension) — Complete

| 18 | Notifications | ✅ | Turn-complete notification when webview unfocused |
| 19 | Prompt Files | ✅ | `.opencode/prompts/*.md`, variable substitution, file watcher |
| 20 | Design Hardening | ✅ | Premium `thinking-pulse` loader, fluid horizontal spacing, optimized tool alignment |
| 21 | Secure Context Attachments | ✅ | Explorer/editor context commands, styled input chips, sensitive-file warnings, prompt-injection checks, read-only context provider |
| 22 | Path-Aware Mentions | ✅ | Debounced file search with path-aware globs and expanded result limit |
| 23 | Unified Session Modal | ✅ | Single list merging local + server sessions, workspace badges, `resume_server_session`, `importOneServerSession` |
| 24 | Changed-Files Chip Bar | ✅ | `file_edited` events accumulated into `session.changedFiles` with deduplication; chip bar re-renders live |
| 25 | Token & Cost Display | ✅ | `StreamCoordinator.finalizeStream` forwards `AssistantMessage.cost` and `.tokens` to webview on every stream completion |
| 26 | Welcome Dashboard | ✅ | Workspace context row, model name, "Continue last session" + "New session" quick actions, recent sessions sorted by recency, 2×2 prompt-starter grid; host-created empty sessions now open a tab immediately |
| 27 | Header Consolidation | ✅ | Status strip below tab bar (model/tokens/cost); settings overflow menu (`#settings-menu`) with MCP + theme entries; 4-button header; `aria-pressed` on all toggles |
| 28 | CLI Session Sharing | ✅ | `OPENCODE_DATA_DIR`/`XDG_DATA_HOME` passed through env-var allowlist; `recoverSessions` no longer workspace-scoped |
| 29 | Theme Customizer + CLI Theme Parity | ✅ | Webview modal with color pickers + Preview button; 7 override fields incl. user message bg; `--bg-secondary`/`--bg-tertiary` removed from CSS_VAR_MAP to preserve `color-mix()` depth; `.vscode-light` body overrides fix light-theme bubble rendering |
| 30 | Empty Session Cleanup + Restore | ✅ | Empty unused sessions are transient, pruned periodically, deleted on close, and non-empty open tabs restore per workspace when enabled |
| 31 | Session Load Performance + Scroll Fixes | ✅ | `resume_session_data` truncated to last 50 msgs + `request_more_messages` pagination; chunked rAF rendering (`CHUNK_SIZE=20`); load-earlier banner; scroll-to-bottom after load; debounced scroll markers + timeline refresh; `content-visibility: auto; contain-intrinsic-size: auto 120px` on messages; `will-change: scroll-position` on message list |
| 32 | Back Button + Modal Focus Traps | ✅ | Back button in header when any modal is open; Tab/Shift+Tab focus cycling within all modals; return-focus-to-trigger on close |
| 33 | Settings Menu Keyboard Nav | ✅ | ArrowUp/Down, Home, End, Escape navigation |
| 34 | Theme Customizer Undo State | ✅ | Save/reset push theme state onto undo stack |
| 35 | Session Recovery Re-push | ✅ | `sessions_recovered` event triggers `pushInitStateToWebview` |
| 36 | Context Optimization Suggestions | ✅ | `ContextMonitor.generateOptimizationSuggestions()` exposed via webview; WebviewEventRouter now calls it on context_suggestions_request |
| 37 | Skills Performance Tracking UI | ✅ | `SkillInfo` extended with `performanceScore`, `usageCount`, `lastUsed`; skills modal displays metrics when available |
| 38 | Context Optimization UI Display | ⏳ | Backend exposed, pending webview panel integration to display suggestions to users |
| 39 | Skill Usage Recording Integration | ⏳ | ConfidenceScorer infrastructure exists, pending integration with actual skill invocation points (architectural work required) |
| 40 | Skills Modal Wiring Repair | ✅ | Fixed stale-closure on `skillsModalOpen` (`main.ts` passed `skillsModalApi?.open` before the API was constructed) by switching to a thunk so the lookup happens at click time; modal now opens reliably |
| 41 | Skill Preferences Persistence | ✅ | New `SkillPreferencesStore` (`globalState`-backed) persists per-skill enable/disable; `toggle_skill` writes through the store and re-emits `skills_list`; `resolveAllSkills` reflects user preference on every list |
| 42 | Methodology ↔ Skills Integration | ✅ | `MethodologyAdvisor` now accepts a `skillHinter`; `ChatProvider` wires `SkillTriggerEngine.getTriggeredSkills(text)` (filtered by enabled skills) into the addendum so the model receives a `Relevant skills: …` line on every classified prompt |

## Deferred (P2 — High Effort / Niche)

| # | Feature | Reason |
|---|---------|--------|
| 17 | Voice Input | Niche (P2), requires Web Speech API or VS Code speech extension |
| 18 | Workspace Indexing | Very High effort — needs persistent embedding index, server-side support |
| 38 | Context Optimization UI Display | Backend exposed via WebviewEventRouter, pending webview panel integration to display suggestions |
| 39 | Skill Usage Recording Integration | ConfidenceScorer infrastructure exists, requires architectural work to identify and integrate with actual skill invocation points |

## Architecture

22 components across 4 layers:

- **Extension Host**: ChatProvider, TabManager, SessionStore, SessionManager, StreamCoordinator, MessageRouter, DiffHandler, ChunkBatcher, ContextEngine, ContextMonitor (with optimization suggestions), ModelManager, RateLimitMonitor, CheckpointManager, ThemeManager, PromptManager, SessionExporter, InlineActionProvider, TerminalBridge, CliDiagnostics, DiffApplier, EventNormalizer
- **Webview**: State, Renderer, DOM, Tabs, Model Dropdown, Mentions, Stream, Scroll Anchor, Theme, Recent Sessions, Search, Slash Autocomplete, Skills Modal (with performance metrics display)
- **Communication**: @opencode-ai/sdk (REST + SSE over localhost)
- **Server**: opencode serve (HTTP, multi-session)
