# opencode-harness — Status

**Last Updated:** 2026-05-31
**Version:** v0.2.23 (+ Unreleased: opencode CLI auto-install)
**Audit:** `docs/adrs/2026-05-04-feature-parity-audit.md`
**TechSpec:** `docs/TechSpec.md`

## Unreleased Highlights

- **Automatic opencode CLI install** — the CLI is a hard requirement, but VS Code has no install-time hook, so the extension now detects a missing binary on activation and installs it. Default is **prompt-once** (Install / Manual Instructions / Not Now), with the choice remembered to avoid nagging; `opencode.autoInstall` (`prompt`|`auto`|`off`) controls it, and `OpenCode: Install CLI` triggers it on demand. macOS/Linux use the official installer (downloaded → validated → `bash <file>` with `shell:false`, no `curl | bash`; lands in `~/.opencode/bin`); Windows uses npm. See ADR `docs/adrs/2026-05-31-cli-auto-install.md`. (`src/install/`, `src/extension.ts`, `src/commands/misc.ts`)
- **Binary detection probes known install dirs** — `ServerLifecycle.findOpencodeBinary()` falls back from PATH to `~/.opencode/bin/opencode` and other common locations, fixing "installed but not detected" for GUI-launched editors whose PATH doesn't include the installer's directory. (`src/session/ServerLifecycle.ts`, `src/install/installPlan.ts`)

## v0.2.20 Highlights

- **Rate-limit/error-handler hardening** — four Critical-severity bugs closed in `errorHandler.ts` (jitter compounding, weak correlation IDs, repeated `acquireVsCodeApi`, mapper whitelist bypass); NaN-propagation eliminated in `RateLimitMonitor.ts` via `safeParseInt`; sliding-window data loss removed; division-by-zero in `quotaMonitor.ts` now returns `undefined` instead of 100%/`NaN`.
- **Pure-function extraction** — `rateLimitCore.ts` now hosts `safeParseInt`, `parseDuration`, all three rate-limit adapters, and their interfaces, separate from the `vscode`-dependent `RateLimitMonitor` class. Zero-impact on callers via re-exports.
- **Test coverage** — 43 new tests across `RateLimitMonitor.test.ts` (17 tests: helpers + adapters + NaN rejection) and `errorHandler.test.ts` (24 tests: classification, retry, jitter, correlation IDs, history, stats, config).
- **Plan / Build / Auto reliability** — user prompts no longer render as `PROPOSED PLAN`; Plan-mode prose styling is assistant-only. Mode changes are host-acknowledged before the dropdown updates, invalid modes are rejected, Auto warning persistence writes `opencode.autoModeConfirmed`, and the selector exposes tooltips plus `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+1/2/3` shortcuts.
- **Plan-mode permission guard** — only direct edits/writes to `.opencode/plans/*.md` are allowed in Plan mode. Shell and external-directory permission requests remain rejected even if their pattern mentions a plan file.
- **Changed-Files dropdown no longer freezes during streaming** — rapid `changed_files_update` events are coalesced into one `requestAnimationFrame` render (was a full `innerHTML` tree rebuild per event); expand/collapse mutates only the affected row; the strip skips unchanged rebuilds; resize is rAF-throttled; previews build via `DocumentFragment`. Review finding: the inline diff accept/reject/apply pipeline is currently unreachable dead code (opencode applies edits server-side) — documented in CHANGELOG, left unwired pending a wire-or-remove decision. (`src/chat/webview/changed-files-dropdown.ts`)
- **"Question from model" block fixed** — model questions now render their text + all answer options and are interactive immediately (mid-stream), not just after `stream_end`. Args are normalized defensively (flat `{question,options}` and Claude-style nested `{questions:[…]}`) by the pure `parseQuestionArgs`; the block refreshes in place as input streams in, is persisted as a real `question` block, and supports multiple question groups + multi-select. Covered by `questionModel.test.ts`, `question-block.test.ts`, and `question-refresh.test.ts`. (`src/chat/webview/questionModel.ts`, `renderer.ts`, `streamHandlers.ts`, `streamEndHandler.ts`, `src/chat/handlers/StreamCoordinator.ts`, `src/session/sdkMessageConverter.ts`)

## v0.2.18 Highlights

- **Frontend streaming correctness** — duplicate persisted assistant messages eliminated (upsert-by-id); `stream_start` is now restartable for a new message id; inter-tool streamed text is no longer dropped at tool boundaries; placeholder removal no longer nukes tool-only turns.
- **Stable-tail streaming render (perf)** — the webview previously re-parsed the entire accumulated buffer on every flush (O(N·k), main thread, cache- and worker-bypassed). A new `LiveTextRenderer` freezes closed markdown blocks (rendered once, cache/worker-eligible) and re-parses only the unstable tail — near-linear, with text selection and `<details>` state surviving mid-stream. See ADR `docs/adrs/2026-05-29-stable-tail-streaming-render.md`.
- **Backfill dedup** — a single `hydrate()` path coalesces concurrent history fetches by `cliSessionId` (no double-fetch across tab-created + session-recovery paths); all pending sessions are processed instead of a fixed `slice(0, 10)`.
- **Branch consolidation** — merged `fix/commands-palette-routing`; resolved leftover merge-conflict markers committed by an earlier botched `show-thinking` merge (ModelManager / main.ts / toolGrouping); fixed a stale renderer streaming-markdown test.
- **Holds:** the syntect→WASM syntax highlighter remains scaffolded-but-inert (activates only when a Rust-enabled CI builds the `.wasm`).

## v0.2.15 Highlights

- **Context window resolves for models the server doesn't report `limit.context` for** — kimi-k2.5, deepseek-v4-flash-free, and most OSS/free-tier models silently lost their context bar in 0.2.13 because the override config was only consulted inside an `if (ctxWindow)` guard. The override now applies regardless, and `onDidChangeConfiguration` re-applies it live without an extension reload.
- **OpenRouter cross-provider fallback** — when our server returns no `limit.context`, the resolver consults a cached catalogue pulled from `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models`. Same model weights share the same window regardless of which provider hosts them, so kimi-k2.5 served by any host now resolves to OpenRouter's canonical entry. Catalogue is persisted to `globalState` with a 24h TTL and refreshed in the background; no hand-curated tables.
- **Clickable "set limit ⚙" affordance** — when both the server and OpenRouter come up empty, clicking the per-tab context monitor opens the `Set Context Window Override` dialog directly instead of showing a tooltip.

## v0.2.14 Highlights

- **Tool calls actually group into one row now** — the 0.2.12 CSS work shrank each tool row but consecutive tool calls still stacked one-per-line because (a) `groupConsecutiveToolCalls` treated every non-tool block (including silent SDK lifecycle blocks) as a group-breaker, and (b) the live-streaming append path bypassed the grouper entirely. The grouper now treats `step-start` and normal `step-finish` as transparent, and a new `appendOrFoldToolDOM` helper folds new tools into the prior `details.tool-group` (or wraps the prior single tool + new tool into a fresh group) at append time. The previous tool's live DOM is moved into the group rather than re-rendered, preserving runtime state (args/result/duration) that the update handlers write directly without going through msg.blocks.

## v0.2.13 Highlights

- **Removed the redundant "Step finished (tool-calls) — in:N out:N reasoning:N" chip rendered after every assistant step** — the renderer's normal-completion short-circuit only matched OpenAI-style underscore reasons (`tool_calls`, `end_turn`), but the SDK in practice emits hyphenated variants (`tool-calls`, `end-turn`), so the chip leaked into every step. `renderStepFinishBlock` now normalizes hyphens to underscores before the set lookup. Genuine non-normal finishes (`length`, `content_filter`, abort, errors) still render the chip so the user sees *why* a step ended unusually.

## v0.2.12 Highlights

- **Show-thinking toggle actually hides thinking blocks now** — previously it only collapsed each `<details>`, leaving the summary chip in the layout. The toggle drives a `hide-thinking` body class and CSS removes `.thinking-block` outright (`display: none`). `setupThinkingToggle()` also applies the persisted pref at boot, so a user's prior choice takes effect on the first load instead of requiring a double-click.
- **Codex-style compact tool blocks** — `.tool-call` no longer renders as a bordered card. Only the left accent stripe survives (so tool class is still color-coded), and `.tool-header` is a single-line row at `min-height: var(--size-target-min)` (24 px) with `text-xs` font. Multi-tool turns stack as a tight one-line log instead of a wall of cards.

## v0.2.11 Highlights

- **First prompt from welcome now sends and renders** — fixed the real blank-tab root cause: prompt context-chip updates were passing attachment-only refs into `updateContextChips`, throwing before `send_prompt` was posted. The send flow now renders the optimistic user message, shows the typing indicator, and posts `send_prompt` with the selected model. A Playwright contract test covers the rendered welcome → send path.
- **Model selection reaches pending tabs** — `ensureLocalTab` now refreshes existing tab model/mode state before stream start, so model selections made on the welcome page are reflected in the first prompt.
- **Empty placeholder sessions are transient again** — empty `pendingServerLink` sessions are no longer persisted/restored or exempt from close cleanup; only server imports awaiting backfill (`needsBackfill`) stay exempt while empty.
- **Changed-files UI is active-session scoped** — changed-file updates now refresh chips/todos only for the active session and clear stale chips when switching tabs.
- **Welcome recent-session delete uses the router contract** — recent delete actions post `targetSessionId`, matching `WebviewEventRouter` validation.
- **Send button silently blocked after extension restart (root cause for "messaging fails completely")** — the webview's persisted `vscode.setState()` snapshot preserved `isStreaming: true` for any session whose stream had been orphaned by a prior dropped `message_complete`. On reload, those stale flags inflated `getStreamCapacityState()` to report 3+ active streams; `sendMessage()` then bailed at its `if (streamCapacity.isFull)` guard *before* posting `send_prompt`. The user typed, pressed Enter, and nothing happened — no log line either. Fixed in `src/chat/webview/state.ts`: `restore()` now clears `isStreaming` on every session because no stream can possibly be in progress across a webview reload.
- **Speculative CLI session creation on resume** — `SessionLifecycleService.handleResumeSession` previously called `ensureSession(undefined)` for any tab without a `cliSessionId`, creating a fresh empty server session just to immediately query its 0 messages. Fix: only re-attach when a `cliSessionId` already exists; pending tabs wait for the first prompt to create the session via `StreamCoordinator`.

## v0.2.10 Highlights

- **Fixed silent event drop on first-message session create** — `ChatProvider.handleServerEvent` no longer drops `file_edited`, `tool_*`, or `message_complete` events that arrive in the race window between `session.create` resolving and `setCliSessionId(...)` running. Events are now buffered (5 s TTL, 200/session cap) and replayed on `TabManager.onCliSessionIdRegistered`. See `docs/adrs/ADR-009-pending-event-buffer.md`. This transitively also resolves the "send button stays disabled after first prompt" symptom — the stuck `isStreaming` flag was a downstream effect of the dropped `message_complete` event.
- **Welcome-page search button works again** — the magnifying-glass icon has `pointer-events: none` in CSS, so a click on the glyph delivered the event with `target === wrapper`. The click handler now triggers on any wrapper-targeted click except clicks on the inner input. Queried searches also surface sessions whose backfill has not yet landed, so users can find an unbacked-filled CLI session by name.
- **Image paste hardened** — the paste handler walks `DataTransferItemList` first, then falls back to `DataTransfer.files` (some Linux desktop clipboards put images only there), and skips past same-MIME entries whose `getAsFile()` returned null instead of bailing on the first MIME match. `preventDefault()` only fires once an image actually attaches.
- **Bounded backfill diagnostics** — after the 4-attempt retry budget is exhausted, `needsBackfill` is cleared on the affected sessions so subsequent `sessions_recovered` events stop re-trying and stop logging "Empty response …" lines. Per-tab "not backfilled" diagnostics are suppressed on the steady-state path.

The single failing test in v0.2.7 (`main.test.ts › timeline jumps use exact message-list scroll positioning`) was a stale source-grep assertion left over from the extraction of `scrollToTurn`/`scrollMessageToTop` into `src/chat/webview/ui/scrollMarkers.ts`. The test now reads from `scrollMarkersSource` where the implementation actually lives.

## Deferred (P2 — High Effort / Niche)

| # | Feature | Reason |
|---|---------|--------|
| 17 | Voice Input | Niche (P2), requires Web Speech API or VS Code speech extension |
| 18 | Workspace Indexing | Very High effort — needs persistent embedding index, server-side support |
| 38 | Context Optimization UI Display | Backend exposed via WebviewEventRouter, pending webview panel integration to display suggestions |
| 39 | Skill Usage Recording Integration | ConfidenceScorer infrastructure exists, requires architectural work to identify and integrate with actual skill invocation points |

## Architecture
